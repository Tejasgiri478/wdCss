Q. Types of css ?
A.  There are mainly 3 types of css 
    1) Inline css : 
        Inline CSS involves applying styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. 
        This method allows for specific styling of elements within the HTML document, 
        overriding any external or internal styles.

    2) Internal (embedded) css :
        Internal or Embedded CSS is defined within the HTML document’s <style> element. 
        It applies styles to specified HTML elements, 
        The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section 
        i.e. the CSS is embedded within the <style> tag inside the head section of the HTML file.

    3) External css :
        External CSS contains separate CSS files that contain only style properties with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc). 
        CSS property is written in a separate file with a .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using a link tag. 
        It means that, for each element, style can be set only once and will be applied across web pages.
